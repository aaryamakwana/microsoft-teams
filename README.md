To run the github code locally:

Start redis server by - "redis-server"
npm i
npm start 



Extra steps that might be needed in case of some error:

delete all package-lock.json and yarn lock files
delete node_modules and reinstall it (npm i) in both client and server side
Run node-server.js before running npm start
